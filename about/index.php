    <p> Asteroids, a classic video game created by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg, served as the inspiration for Galaxy Scavenger. Asteroids was one of the biggest blockbusters of the heyday of arcade games when it was first released. As they years have gone by, arcade games are no longer widely available and exceedingly difficult to find in Mauritius. Galaxy Scavenger was created as a result to allow the younger generation to both experience and enjoy this fantastic and addictive game.
